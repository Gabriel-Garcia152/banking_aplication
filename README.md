# banking_aplication

It's my first low-level language self-driven project ever.

This project simulates a bank application and allows users to:

* Create accounts;
* Update accounts' informations;
* Display accounts' informations;
* Perform transactions (withdraws and deposits);
* Access transactions history;
* Delete accounts;

There's also a log-in system and a main menu wich guides the user through all functions.

Currently it uses a console-based interface, I plan to apply a GUI for user-friendly purposes soon.
